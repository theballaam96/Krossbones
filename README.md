# Krossbones
Krossbones is a KROSS-platform bareBONES autotracker for DK64 Randomizer. This solely autotracks items you have obtained and serves as a solution for Linux and Mac users who are waiting in [Track-o-Matic](https://github.com/Brian0255/Track-O-Matic) and [GSTHD](https://github.com/jxjacob/GSTHD) to have their cross-platform updates.
